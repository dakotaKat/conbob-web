# Welcome to Consolidated Bobcat, LLC
Welcome to Consolidated Bobcat, the home of various endeavours and consulting services. We're a wireless kind of person - exploring, researching, and understanding the world of cellular and providing our knowledge - our *grimoire* - direct to you.

## What we Do
We specialize right now in cellular technology, and are working with our industry partners to deliver private white-label LTE networks direct to you.

We're working on our Evolved Packet Core technology and software package to be able to provide "plug and (mostly) play" solutions to run LTE wherever you are for your own devices. We also are planning on providing Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) offerings both to enterprise and the public, including CBRS CPI services for enterprises deploying hardware but need a CPI to sign off on your installation. Our trained installer team will be able to assist you in planning and deployment.

We're also working on some other hardware projects right now, but we're not ready to launch or announce those yet!
